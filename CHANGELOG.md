# Changelog

## Version 1.0.0
- Initial mod release.
- A large portion of the game is translated, however, quite a few translations are still missing, especially from the terminal.

## Version 1.0.1
- Fixed a few small typos.

## Version 1.0.2
- Added missing translations for most of the purchasable items, as well as some interactive and UI elements. 

## Version 1.0.3
- Added missing translations for rest of the purchasable items.
- Corrected shown keybinds for the Finnish keyboard.
- Fixed some other translations.

## Version 1.0.4
- Added translations for content added in game version 45.
- Added regex for translations that include keybinds, for the future, when the game actually updates them correctly (this effectively negates the corrected keybinds of Version 1.0.3).
- Fixed a bunch of translations, again.

## Version 1.1.0
- Added a patcher file.
  * Freedom units (pounds) are now correctly converted into kilograms.
  * Added many missing translations for the terminal.

## Version 1.1.1
- Fixed some item and terminal translations.

## Version 1.1.2
- Added missing translations for rest of the terminal.
- Fixed many other translations.
- **Note:** This will likely be the final "regular" update, even though there are still at least a couple of missing translations that have proven especially difficult to deal with. I strongly urge you to [open an issue](https://github.com/AceHanded/LC-Finnish-Localization-Mod/issues) on the mod's GitHub page if you discover a translation that you think is either missing, spelt wrong, or just blatantly incorrect. I will try to correct the opened issues as soon as possible.
